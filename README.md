# spatial-sound
This repository is dedicated to showcasing a successful experiment in 3D/spatial sound utilizing JavaScript. It features an immersive audio experience where the "user" can navigate through a virtual environment and perceive various sounds emanating from multiple directions. The application leverages the Web Audio API to create a spatial audio landscape, providing users with an interactive way to explore how sound behaves in a three-dimensional space.
